2
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,987
Sure I have.

3
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:31,546
Well, I've discovered why sex is.
You have? Fantastic!

4
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:34,434
It's because humans
don't live underwater.

5
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,034
I don't get it.

6
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:42,634
Fish don't need sex, because they just lay
the eggs and fertilize them in the water.

7
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:45,947
Humans can't do that
because they don't live in water.

8
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:49,995
They have to... internalize the water.
Therefore we have sex.

9
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:54,035
So you mean humans wouldn't have sex
if they lived in the water?

10
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:59,474
They'd have a kind of sex. The kind where
you wouldn't have to touch each other.

11
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,114
I like that idea.

12
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:04,348
Have you heard of scuba diving?
It's just new.

13
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:07,668
Self-contained underwater
breathing apparatus.

14
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,315
Exactly.

15
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:16,235
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. You ask her.

16
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:26,474
Raffaella, will you have sex with us
in our bathtub? It's an experiment.

17
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:30,267
Are you kidding?
Fuck off, you freaks!

18
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,666
I'm telling my father you talk dirty.

19
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:36,909
Besides, I know for a fact
you don't even know what "fuck" is!

20
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,629
They're so different from us...

21
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,709
and all because
we don't live underwater.

22
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:56,871
The morculum is working superbly.

23
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,393
Shall I insert the manticulator?
Please.

24
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,675
What's the diagnosis?

25
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,435
Intra-ovular surgery.

26
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Where did you get that instrument?

27
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,880
We had it made for us.
Really?

28
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,993
Might be fine for a cadaver.
It won't work with a living patient.

29
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:19,796
To our fabulous twins...

30
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,714
who have, as mere undergraduates...

31
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,315
already brought us glory.

32
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,675
Hear, hear!

33
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,717
And here it is...

34
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,640
in solid gold...

35
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:35,872
Er, well, solid gold plate, that is!

36
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:41,675
The Mantle retractor, which is now
the standard of the industry.

37
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,719
Here's to a brilliant future!

38
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:00,280
Here it is.

39
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,201
That's wonderful!

40
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,431
Yeah.

41
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:18,833
They got the pivot pin in backwards.

42
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:21,482
Bev, you should've been there.

43
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,161
I was.

44
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:43,639
Well?
Are all the necessary parts there, Doc?

45
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:45,522
Yes, they are.

46
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:50,153
And there are a couple of extra ones
that shouldn't be.

47
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,802
Not funny.

48
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:56,959
Er, no... I wasn't joking.

49
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:07,158
Would you excuse me a minute?
I'll be right back.

50
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:22,084
Elly, I want you to look at
this woman before you go.

51
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:27,396
I'm late, Bev. If I fuck up with the
chairman's wife, we lose our grant.

52
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:31,274
She's a trifurcate.
I've never seen anything like it.

53
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,325
Down in a minute. It's Dr. Mantle.
Keep the car waiting. Thanks.

54
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,321
Is this Claire Niveau?

55
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:39,555
Yeah.

56
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,764
What, the Claire Niveau?
Yeah.

57
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:46,801
Ooh! What's she doing here?

58
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:51,881
A mini-series. She's got three agents
and a bodyguard in the waiting room.

59
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:55,641
And her life is empty without children.
How did you know?

60
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,765
Bev, everyone knows that! Don't you
ever read the National Enquirer?

61
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,759
"Star's life empty without children."

62
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:08,046
I hope it also explained how we can make
her fertile, because I don't think I can.

63
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,562
Then we'll have to see what I can do.

64
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:14,526
Elly, what about dinner
with the chairman's wife?

65
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:20,082
I guess la bella contessa
will have to wait.

66
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,602
Right, let's take another look.

67
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,365
Yes...

68
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,320
That's fantastic.

69
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:47,606
I've never had anybody say that
about the inside of my body before.

70
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:50,838
Surely you've heard of inner beauty?

71
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:59,527
I've often thought there should be
beauty contests for the insides of bodies.

72
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,280
You know, best spleen...

73
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:06,648
Most perfectly developed kidneys...
Why don't we have standards of beauty...

74
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:09,800
for the entire human body...

75
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:11,844
inside and out?

76
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,523
I have a feeling you do.

77
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:17,600
So I'll tell 'em to fuck off.
Pardon my French.

78
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:22,558
Don't tell them to fuck off. I need the work.
This mini-series is paying peanuts.

79
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,118
You don't need to be humiliated.

80
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,961
I've decided.

81
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:29,085
I want to be humiliated.

82
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,678
Tell me about my uterus.

83
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,286
Well, it has three doorways.

84
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:45,158
Three cervixes leading into
three separate compartments...

85
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,969
in your uterus.
That is fabulously rare.

86
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,085
Do you have trouble with your periods?

87
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:56,528
Listen... um... I'm gonna be late
for the Axelrod meeting. You'll be OK?

88
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,968
Goodbye, Leo. Remember, I need
the humiliation as well as the money.

89
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,725
I almost never have periods.

90
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:13,486
Once or twice a year.

91
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,925
Not very enthusiastic ones.

92
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,248
Could I have triplets, do you think?
One in each compartment?

93
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,084
No. It doesn't work like that.

94
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:26,001
Really?

95
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,685
How does it work?

96
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:32,809
How did it go with la bella contessa?

97
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:36,687
Did we get our grant?

98
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:38,921
You were great.

99
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:41,765
Seductive and charming as usual.

100
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:46,123
And I think you've got your grant.

101
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,565
Hey...

102
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:49,404
wait a minute.

103
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:52,529
What's this I hear?
It's for us, not just for me.

104
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,172
It's for Mantle Inc.
Yes, yes.

105
00:10:57,172 --> 00:10:59,732
I know.
Did she catch on?

106
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:10,050
Ah, Contessa, you're looking so...

107
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:13,489
I don't know,
so Catherine Deneuve tonight!

108
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:17,769
And how is Marcello?

109
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:23,323
Due cappuccini, per favore, and quickly.
The Countess...

110
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,372
is a tigress until she's got
her caffeine in the morning!

111
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,721
Hey...

112
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:33,610
come on...

113
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,252
I'm not that bad.

114
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,292
You're a little bit smoother in real life.

115
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,409
And the movie star...

116
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:42,450
how is she?

117
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:46,082
She's expecting me for lunch tomorrow.

118
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:50,411
So you're going to find out for yourself.

119
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,849
Oh, no!
Oh, yes.

120
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,645
It's all set up.

121
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:59,488
The production's rented her
this little apartment...

122
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,485
in Rosedale!

123
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,929
She'll just be getting out of bed...

124
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:06,370
all cozy and warm.

125
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,846
Look, Elly...
the clinic's booked to the hilt.

126
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,925
We've got to pay the rent, you know.

127
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:17,768
I'll take your patients.
Oh, yes

128
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:20,806
I want you to go.

129
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,643
Bev, you've got to try the movie star.

130
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,570
She's unbelievable.

131
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:33,614
Don't worry, you'll be all right.

132
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,731
Just do me.

133
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,856
What did you do to me last night?

134
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:21,611
I'm still vibrating all over.

135
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,006
I learnt it from books.

136
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:27,772
Mmm, I wish more men
would read those books!

137
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,936
Drink?

138
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,973
No... thanks.

139
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,411
Well, Doc...

140
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,534
what's the prognosis?

141
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,775
Can I have a baby... or can't I?

142
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:17,089
You're asking me that now?
I-I mean, here?

143
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,376
You said the results would be back today.

144
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,688
There's no chance that you'll
be able to bear children.

145
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,375
I'm not surprised.

146
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,815
You must've been tested before.

147
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,849
Oh, they said... I wouldn't have
an easy time getting pregnant.

148
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,216
But I've been taking...

149
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,255
hormone injections.

150
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,412
And I have been extremely promiscuous.

151
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,698
I've never...

152
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:12,420
used... um... contraceptive devices.

153
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:16,050
I've never even thought
contraceptive thoughts.

154
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:22,618
There are other reasons for
not sleeping with just... anybody.

155
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:27,257
That's true, you know.
I never thought of that.

156
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,097
Oh, of course, you...

157
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:33,976
had a chance to...

158
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:35,892
check me out...

159
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,937
thoroughly...

160
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,377
before you jumped on me.

161
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:44,214
Are you that careful?
Do you only have affairs with patients?

162
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,896
No, I was... concerned...

163
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:49,337
Am I bad? Is that it?

164
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:53,051
You gonna spank me, Doc?

165
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,938
It hadn't occurred to me.

166
00:15:57,742 --> 00:15:59,654
I've been bad...

167
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,051
and I need to be punished.

168
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,778
I need to be punished.

169
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:23,695
Danuta.

170
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:26,657
Danuta.

171
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,494
Danuta!

172
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:37,093
As soon as we get some cold water
on your face, you'll feel much better.

173
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:45,098
Elly...

174
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:48,335
What happened?
Thank God you're back, Bev!

175
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,773
I'm just no good with the serious ones.

176
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,855
Why are you back?

177
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:58,658
I'm just no good with the frivolous ones.

178
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:02,817
All she wanted was
a little slap on the arse, Bev.

179
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,337
Yeah?

180
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:09,736
Yeah, well, I wondered what the fuck
my brother had got us into...

181
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:11,576
behind my back.

182
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,622
She's an actress, Bev, she's a flake.

183
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:19,255
She plays games all the time.
You never know who she really is.

184
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,498
Yeah.

185
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,217
I can see that.

186
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,777
You can?

187
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,218
Yeah!

188
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:35,096
So... when are you gonna see her again?
She's called the clinic five times already.

189
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,144
I don't know. Perhaps you'd better go.

190
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:41,301
Wait a minute...

191
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:44,421
this is serious.

192
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,461
No, it's not.
Yes, it is!

193
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,618
If we didn't share women,
you'd still be a virgin.

194
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,981
No.
You'd never get laid on your own.

195
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,465
I don't get out much.

196
00:17:55,907 --> 00:18:00,297
Listen, the beauty of our business
is you don't have to get out...

197
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:04,173
to meet beautiful women.
No, I can't do that. It's not...

198
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,700
Ethical.
No.

199
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,382
It's not... safe.

200
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,137
Well, if you don't go and see her...

201
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:17,141
What?
I will.

202
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,782
And I'll tell her I'm you...

203
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,540
and I'll do... terrible things to her.

204
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,502
What sort of terrible things?

205
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:09,585
Oh, God!

206
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,268
Oh, Doctor...

207
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,344
you've cured me!

208
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:47,226
Shh, shh.

209
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,870
What's the matter, what's the matter?

210
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,666
I'll never get pregnant.

211
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,987
I'll never have children.

212
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,143
When I'm dead... I'll just be dead.

213
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,948
I'll...

214
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,666
really never have been a woman
at all. Just a girl.

215
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,546
A little girl.

216
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,624
You could always adopt a baby.

217
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:34,547
It wouldn't be the same.
It wouldn't be part of my body.

218
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,986
Yes... that's true.

219
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:42,071
Don't tell. Please don't tell...

220
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:46,830
anybody about me. Please don't tell.

221
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:53,025
I'm so vulnerable... I'm slashed open.

222
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,472
Who would I tell? Eh?

223
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,464
Who would I tell?

224
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:08,909
And with that seal of approval,
our 5th bubbly season gets under way.

225
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:13,784
Hey, hey, hey...

226
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,829
it's the swinger!

227
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:18,228
Yeah... hi.

228
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:20,869
So?

229
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,671
Er, so...

230
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,425
it was nice.

231
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:30,624
She's... a little crazy, but sweet.

232
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,985
Tell me all about it.

233
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:35,222
Later.

234
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:38,908
No, now.
You might forget something later.

235
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,949
Some yummy detail.

236
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,025
I don't want to tell you about it.

237
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,069
You don't what?

238
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:51,109
I want to keep it...

239
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:54,025
for myself.

240
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,148
Listen...

241
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,943
you haven't had any experience
until I've had it, too.

242
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:09,142
You haven't fucked Claire Niveau
until you tell me about it.

243
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,544
Then I haven't fucked Claire Niveau.

244
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:19,226
There's no point to
this discussion, Arlene.

245
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:22,307
There is a point.
There definitely is a point!

246
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:25,784
You started with me
and now you won't carry through.

247
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:29,508
And... we have a relationship!

248
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,272
But you test out fine.

249
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:38,075
It's your husband that's the problem...

250
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:41,148
and all he probably needs
is a good sperm wash.

251
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:45,229
If it's only a matter of laundry,
why are you opposed to doing it?

252
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:47,272
We don't do husbands.

253
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:52,509
We do female infertility.
We do women. That's our specialty.

254
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,393
I am a woman...

255
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:56,546
and I want you to take care of me.

256
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:58,149
I trust you.

257
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,591
It's hard enough to find someone...

258
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:03,907
in the medical profession
that you can trust.

259
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:09,149
Arlene, that's... that's wonderful.
I mean, that's really wonderful...

260
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,466
but we don't do husbands.

261
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,548
We don't deliver babies, either.

262
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:16,275
We make women fertile,
and that's all we do.

263
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:23,705
To achieve anything in life,
one has to keep life simple.

264
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:26,275
Don't you think?

265
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,309
Irrigation.

266
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:36,153
It'd be an exaggeration to say we can
make up a new set of fallopian tubes...

267
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,149
using just anything that's handy.

268
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:45,266
Those tubes are highly specialized
little organs.

269
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,148
But with the kind of help
we can offer the process...

270
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:53,789
it is possible to...
modify several other organs:

271
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:55,833
the odd vein...

272
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:57,476
or, as today...

273
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:00,834
we're using
a femoral lymphatic vessel...

274
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:04,388
to take over the function
of conveying the egg...

275
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:07,473
from the ovary to the uterus.

276
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,511
What are you taking?

277
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:24,555
Let me see.

278
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,595
"Dextroamphetamine resin."

279
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,557
"Dosage form: capsule."

280
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:31,197
"7.5 milligrams."

281
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:33,952
"Use: short-term treatment of obesity."

282
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,191
"Minor side effects:
dry mouth, palpitations...

283
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,431
restlessness,
unpleasant taste in mouth."

284
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,475
"Major...

285
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,516
side effects:

286
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,758
sleeplessness, rapid heartbeat...

287
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,073
euphoria."

288
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,433
Do you want one?

289
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,156
Where did you learn all that?

290
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:12,996
Doctor, the Physician's Desk Reference
is my favorite bedside reading.

291
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,195
As a matter of fact...

292
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,072
they tell me that there's a high
incidence of drug use amongst doctors.

293
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,594
Is that true?
Yep.

294
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,433
Do you take drugs?

295
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,353
No.

296
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:30,033
Well, for pain.

297
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,959
Pain creates character distortion.

298
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:37,955
It's simply not necessary.

299
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,831
I'm often in a lot of pain.

300
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,836
What kind of pain?

301
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,597
I think...

302
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,552
psychosexual.

303
00:25:56,801 --> 00:26:00,158
I'd say that was a pretty astute diagnosis.

304
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:04,875
Though I wouldn't recommend you
using those for that condition.

305
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:06,873
Who prescribed them for you?

306
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:12,755
When you get to be a famous actress...
well, doctors are...

307
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:14,798
friendly.

308
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:20,836
Do me a favor. Will you allow me
to do the prescribing for you?

309
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,039
Thanks, Arthur.

310
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:33,682
You've forgotten to sign this, Dr. Mantle.

311
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:35,117
Oh.

312
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,321
Sorry.

313
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,838
Actually, my name's Denis.

314
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:45,083
Sorry. I always get you confused.

315
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,955
Bye again.

316
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,558
If I had a game of squash now, Terry,
I'd end up a dead man.

317
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,522
I may win, but I'd be
dead at the end of it.

318
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:58,804
Tired?
Yeah, that last one was rough.

319
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,637
Were you there?
No, I'll watch the tape.

320
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:04,717
I'll need it to get the FT paper
in shape, anyway.

321
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,759
Boston's yelling at me for it.

322
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:10,757
Hello, Mary. Then I'll just need
your tissue rejection data.

323
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,402
How's that coming along?

324
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:16,442
Listen, how about I write the paper
one time and you collect the data?

325
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:20,153
Sure. Just say when. Do you want
to see how it's shaping up?

326
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:23,236
No, I trust you to make us look good.

327
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,204
I'm exhausted.

328
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,799
Too exhausted to see Claire tonight?

329
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,600
No. Never.

330
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:40,995
You'll need these.
What's that?

331
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,235
Butazamine.

332
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,920
She's heard that it makes sex
come on like Nagasaki.

333
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:52,361
You're not feeding her pills, are you?

334
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:54,402
Listen, baby brother...

335
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:59,485
I've got her number.
This lady's hustling us for drugs.

336
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:03,197
I don't think that's true at all.

337
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:07,164
I think we should drop her, Bev.
You drop her!

338
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:18,276
This is unknown territory
we're moving into.

339
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:24,398
Just cos we're handcuffed together
doesn't mean I have to like you!

340
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:25,919
Handcuffs?

341
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,679
You don't get it, do you?

342
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:29,325
Listen, honey-mud...

343
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:33,718
we're on the run... and until we find
the release code to this thing...

344
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:36,764
we're gonna get to know
each other real well.

345
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,760
I suggest we learn to like what we see.

346
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:44,805
You're a very self-conscious reader.

347
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,124
Just... Just loosen up...

348
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,244
and play.

349
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,079
Come on.

350
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:57,996
Didn't you ever do routines
as a kid? Impersonations?

351
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:01,558
The only impersonation I ever did
was my brother.

352
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:06,121
I didn't know you had a brother.

353
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,521
Yeah.

354
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,280
We're not very close.

355
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:15,281
Beverly... That's a woman's name.

356
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:20,356
Why did your mom give you
a woman's name, I wonder?

357
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:23,283
It's not a woman's name.
It's spelled differently.

358
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:27,919
It's still a woman's name. Does your
brother have a woman's name, too?

359
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,000
Merian... spelled with an E...

360
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,681
and an A.

361
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,843
What are you trying to suggest?
That I'm gay or something?

362
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,806
My mother wanted girls?

363
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:42,599
What the fuck is this
bullshit psychoanalysis!

364
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,608
Listen, Doctor...

365
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:58,360
I think there's something
wrong with you.

366
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,764
I don't know what it is,
I can't put a label on it, but...

367
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,368
you're subtly...

368
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,162
I don't know...

369
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,081
schizophrenic...

370
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,126
or something.

371
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,319
Sometimes I like you very much...

372
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,487
and sometimes you're an amusing lay.
Not much more.

373
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,887
And I can't figure out...

374
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:31,722
why.

375
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,607
Beverly.

376
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,250
One for you.

377
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:59,684
One for me.

378
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:13,529
Please come this way.

379
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:23,962
My dear...

380
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:28,683
Sit down, have a drink...

381
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,729
and tell me everything.

382
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:33,809
I'm not sure I know everything.

383
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:37,044
Start with all this
I've been hearing about you...

384
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,806
and the wonderful Mantle boys.

385
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:41,644
What are you talking about?

386
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:47,643
Claire, this is me - Laura.
Please don't be coy, it's tedious.

387
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:52,330
Dear Beverly...

388
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,166
dear Elliot.

389
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:57,563
Some claim they can't
tell the difference...

390
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:01,249
but not me, dear.
It's obvious to me that...

391
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:07,405
Well, before I say anything gauche,
tell me which one you're seeing.

392
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,690
You mean there's two of them?

393
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:13,609
Don't be an ass, dear.
Of course there are two of them.

394
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:17,171
They're twins, dear.

395
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:20,008
Identical twins.

396
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,207
My dear, you've gone absolutely pale.

397
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:27,770
Have I said something?

398
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:32,006
No, no, not at all.
Where's that waiter? I want some coffee.

399
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:35,330
Oh, how sick-making.

400
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:39,687
I have said something, haven't I?

401
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:44,174
You know,
I could get very fond of Butazamine.

402
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,009
Ooooh...!

403
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,052
Beverly...

404
00:32:56,535 --> 00:33:00,608
why haven't you told me that
your brother isn't just a brother?

405
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:03,449
Ah, th... Ah, that.

406
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:05,094
Yes, that.

407
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:09,367
It never occurred to me.
I mean, he is just a brother.

408
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,208
Um...

409
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:13,857
Is it important?
Is it important?

410
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:18,128
I've heard you live together
in the same apartment.

411
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,967
Yeah, that's true.

412
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,086
We both like Italian furniture.

413
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:25,531
God! Do you sleep in the same bed?

414
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,413
Oh, Claire, come on!

415
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:29,055
You come on!

416
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,774
You told me...

417
00:33:30,857 --> 00:33:33,246
you and your brother weren't close.

418
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:39,326
And now I find out
not only are you identical twins...

419
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,372
but you live together...

420
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:44,413
in the same apartment.

421
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:49,849
What's he like...

422
00:33:49,938 --> 00:33:51,576
your twin?

423
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:58,689
Well, I mean... er...

424
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:01,808
Of course, h-he looks a lot like me.

425
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:05,446
Are you identical psychologically?

426
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:07,494
Um...

427
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:11,047
No, I wouldn't say that.

428
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,170
When can I meet him?

429
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:16,215
You can't. I mean...

430
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,256
you don't want to.

431
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:25,737
But, Beverly... don't you understand?

432
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:31,010
I have to meet him.

433
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:32,248
Why?

434
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,693
I want to know everything about you.

435
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:38,896
I don't think it's a good idea.

436
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:42,528
You don't want me to meet your twin.
Why is that?

437
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,576
It's... It's difficult.

438
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,217
It's very difficult.

439
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:49,894
That's it, you see. I want to know
why it's difficult for you.

440
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:53,255
My button...
It's important to me to know why.

441
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,011
I suppose I...

442
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,534
I could arrange for you and...

443
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,371
Elliot...

444
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,736
to have a drink together.

445
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,776
Uh-uh. Nix.

446
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,657
No good.

447
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,492
Why?

448
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,854
I want to see you two together.

449
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,699
I know he's going to have to in the end.

450
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,497
Ah, there you are.
Here I am.

451
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,221
I've been really looking forward to this.

452
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,098
Well... er...

453
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,933
Claire Niveau...

454
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:46,977
this is my brother Elliot.

455
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:51,373
Hi, Claire... I hope Bev's told you
what a big fan I am of your movies.

456
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:55,420
No, he hasn't. As a matter of fact,
he hasn't mentioned you at all.

457
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,857
Really? That's not very flattering.

458
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,620
Well...

459
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,454
Are you going to sit down?

460
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,499
Yes, I am.

461
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:15,220
I feel such a fool, actually.
I must be the only woman in town...

462
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:18,612
who doesn't know about
the fabulous Mantle twins.

463
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:21,414
What are you drinking?

464
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:26,896
Nothing. I want to be very sober right
at this moment. I want to be very clear.

465
00:36:33,703 --> 00:36:37,456
There really isn't any
telling you apart, is there?

466
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:40,103
Absolutely identical in every respect.

467
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:43,060
I'm actually a couple
of millimeters taller.

468
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:49,094
I bet somebody who knew you both.
how shall I put it?

469
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:52,334
Knew you both really well...

470
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:54,379
could tell the difference.

471
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:57,899
Without measuring your height, I mean.

472
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,736
What do you mean?

473
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:04,022
Beverly's the sweet one,
and you're the shit. Am I right?

474
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:08,620
This is some feisty lady
you've found, Beverly!

475
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:13,732
Elliot, let's ease up on the bullshit for
a moment. You can be honest with me.

476
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:16,384
After all, I am laying
both of you, aren't I?

477
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:17,942
Er, now, hang on a...

478
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:20,413
It's a sweet little act you have.

479
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,655
You soften them up
with all that smarmy concern...

480
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:27,215
and along comes Dracula here
and polishes them off.

481
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:32,773
I was the one who fucked you first...

482
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:36,573
but I gave you to my baby brother
because you weren't very good.

483
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,814
Oh, God, no! Um... Claire...

484
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,656
let me explain...

485
00:37:40,744 --> 00:37:42,974
You absolute shit!

486
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:46,944
Explain what?! Explain... what?
Listen...

487
00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:52,622
I've been around a bit. I've seen some
creepy things in the movie business.

488
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:55,981
This is the most disgusting thing
that's ever happened to me.

489
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,863
I doubt that.
What is it with you, chum?

490
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:02,494
You can't get it up
unless little brother's watching?

491
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:04,542
I told you this was a bad idea.

492
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:09,781
Really stupid. I'm leaving.
Don't bother.

493
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:21,421
That solves that little problem.

494
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:24,584
Jesus, Bev!

495
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,225
Hey!

496
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,702
What's going on?
I don't know, I'm... I'm... er...

497
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:32,344
a bit upset.

498
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:37,424
Listen, I'll go and catch up with her.

499
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:40,067
I'll tell her it was all my fault.
No!

500
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,459
Leave her alone.

501
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:49,776
I'll sort it out.

502
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:53,663
I give you the winner
of the 1988 Feldman Award:

503
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,306
Dr. Elliot Mantle!

504
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:15,818
I suppose all of us know
just how important it is...

505
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:19,901
for a practitioner to receive
the recognition of his peers.

506
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:24,378
However,
I feel that this award tonight...

507
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,822
is not really for me...

508
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:30,025
but rather for those women...

509
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:33,384
who have provided
that most precious thing:

510
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:35,903
The gift of life.

511
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:47,861
I want to thank Dr. Angus Lawson...
Hi, how are you?

512
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:51,339
Who gave me the time to pursue
my own research.

513
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:55,661
But most of all
I want to thank my brother...

514
00:39:55,748 --> 00:39:59,060
my partner, Dr. Beverly Mantle...

515
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:04,587
who, true to form, is not here
wasting time basking in glory.

516
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,706
Here, take mine.

517
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:09,987
But is hard at work at the Mantle Clinic...

518
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:12,025
Not true!

519
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,464
Not true! I'm here!

520
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,108
Oh, sorry.

521
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,505
I see Beverly has been doing
a little basking, after all!

522
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,343
He has a lot to celebrate.

523
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:35,822
He has been recognized as one of
North America's leading clinicians.

524
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,549
Ladies and gentlemen...

525
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,188
Dr. Beverly Mantle.

526
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:42,631
You all right?
Had rather a lot to drink.

527
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,667
Just want to say something.

528
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:47,983
I just want to say some...

529
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:50,947
I just want to say something.

530
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:56,507
There's been a fraud
perpetrated here tonight.

531
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:02,542
The whole thing's a fraud!

532
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:09,109
He's Beverly and I'm Elliot!

533
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:11,581
Just say thank you and get off.
No!

534
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:14,470
I want to say something else!

535
00:41:14,551 --> 00:41:16,986
A lot of you are probably wondering...

536
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:19,028
how we divide the work.

537
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:22,108
Well, it's like this...

538
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:26,945
I slave over the hot snatches...

539
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:31,582
and Elliot... makes the speeches!

540
00:41:31,673 --> 00:41:33,106
For God's sake!

541
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:38,220
I do everything for those bimbos, except
take them home and stick it in them!

542
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:46,864
Well, he's clearly been doing a lot
of celebrating. Who can blame him?

543
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:48,909
Thank you so much. Thank you.

544
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:10,552
I'm sorry about the catastrophe
last night.

545
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:15,986
It's true I had to smooth
a few ruffled feathers this morning.

546
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:18,668
But now, baby brother...

547
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,312
for the good news.

548
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:21,827
Lawson has...

549
00:42:21,913 --> 00:42:26,227
finally offered me the associate
professorship at the hospital.

550
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:29,864
One vodka martini, Doctor.
Thank you, Sean.

551
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:34,184
Are you going to accept?
Of course I'm going to accept.

552
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:37,347
It's the next step to
chairman of the department.

553
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:40,427
What about the practice?
It goes on as before.

554
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:44,063
Except you're not there.
I won't be there as much, no.

555
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,986
I'm not eating.

556
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,430
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

557
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:00,755
What are those?

558
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:02,791
Dex. I'm tired.

559
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,788
Want one?
Er... no, thanks.

560
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,833
If I can fly around, teach,
and do research...

561
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:12,067
surely you can find time
for a few more patients?

562
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,874
Sure. Why not?

563
00:43:49,517 --> 00:43:51,075
Good God!

564
00:43:52,117 --> 00:43:55,666
I didn't know you were here.
Shh, shh. Elly's asleep.

565
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:58,713
His plane doesn't go till noon.

566
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,477
I didn't realize you two were so friendly.

567
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,514
We're not so friendly.

568
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:11,390
You gonna take a shower?

569
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:13,831
Um...

570
00:44:14,957 --> 00:44:16,789
No, I... er...

571
00:44:16,877 --> 00:44:18,675
You go ahead.

572
00:44:20,038 --> 00:44:21,596
OK.

573
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:23,110
See ya.

574
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:32,514
It seems so... cold and empty.

575
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:37,195
You can call it empty,
or you can call it clean, sculptural.

576
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:41,830
It's a question of the individual
nervous system, I think.

577
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:44,797
That presupposes one has
an individual nervous system.

578
00:44:44,878 --> 00:44:46,197
Please?

579
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,469
Er... thank you, I'll...

580
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,312
I'll think about it.

581
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:16,559
Claire...

582
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,994
Yes?

583
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:24,349
Oh...

584
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:27,678
it's you.

585
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:35,679
Or should I say, which one of you is it?

586
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:37,911
Please, Claire, don't.

587
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,349
Are you still doing the mini-series?

588
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,911
Re-shoots. The director didn't
know what he was doing.

589
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:02,834
Well...

590
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:06,117
tell me how sorry you are.

591
00:46:07,882 --> 00:46:09,838
Tell me how much you miss me.

592
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:15,994
My brother and I have always
shared everything.

593
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:17,640
I'm not a thing.

594
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:19,678
I mean people...

595
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:21,513
experiences.

596
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,871
It's never bothered me before now.

597
00:46:26,802 --> 00:46:28,758
It's different with me, is it?

598
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:31,276
Yes.

599
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:33,115
Yes, it is.

600
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,718
Is Elliot jealous of me?

601
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,442
Is he worried
I'll steal you away from him?

602
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:51,879
No, he offered to come
and talk to you for me...

603
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:53,919
to patch things up.

604
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:55,959
That would've been amusing.

605
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:57,716
Why didn't he?

606
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:00,476
I wouldn't let him.

607
00:47:00,563 --> 00:47:04,351
Were you afraid I might like him
as much as I like you?

608
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:07,439
Or maybe...

609
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:11,074
when it came down to it...

610
00:47:13,404 --> 00:47:15,554
I couldn't see the difference.

611
00:47:15,643 --> 00:47:17,554
No!

612
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:20,442
It doesn't work that way between us.

613
00:47:20,844 --> 00:47:22,800
I think it does.

614
00:47:23,604 --> 00:47:26,243
I think you two have
never come to terms...

615
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:29,873
with the way it really
does work between you.

616
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:42,841
No! Not while he's here.

617
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:47,241
I don't want him to see us.

618
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,037
All right...

619
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:52,685
I'll just... separate you.

620
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:55,643
Separate us?

621
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:57,681
What do you mean?

622
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:16,242
Ohh! Ohh! No! No! No! No!

623
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:22,725
What happened?

624
00:48:22,806 --> 00:48:25,115
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was dreaming.

625
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:26,958
What about?
About Elliot.

626
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:30,201
What happened?
Oh, don't! Don't!

627
00:48:30,286 --> 00:48:32,437
Don't... touch it.

628
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:34,279
Come to bed.

629
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:36,725
Oh, Claire...

630
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:40,163
I don't want to dream that again.
I can't!

631
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:46,605
Take one of these.

632
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:48,246
What's that?
Seconal.

633
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:50,397
I guarantee you, you won't dream.

634
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:15,083
Don't let me dream that again.

635
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:21,441
The message that clearly emerges
from these complex encounters...

636
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:23,644
between physician and patient...

637
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:26,844
is that there is not only
a place in the clinic...

638
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:32,002
but a demand for a philosophy.
A philosophy which mixes...

639
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:36,878
compassionate curiosity
with social responsibility.

640
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,769
They'll discover they're gonna have to.

641
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:44,846
Yeah.

642
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:48,968
Yeah. Look, David, I've got to go.
I've got company.

643
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:51,687
All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

644
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,325
Dr. Elliot Mantle?
Yes.

645
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,639
Special order from Escort Embassy.

646
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,481
I'm Mimsy...

647
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:10,526
and this is my sister Coral.

648
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,882
Hi.

649
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,403
Would you like some of this?

650
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:17,048
Sure.

651
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:37,646
Listen, so that I know
which one of you is which...

652
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:41,767
I'd like you...

653
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,239
Coral.
Coral.

654
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,083
To call me Elly...

655
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:48,687
and you, Mimsy...

656
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,805
to call me Bev.

657
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:13,728
Oh, shit!
Watch it.

658
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:16,202
She's got it, Beverly.

659
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:20,969
A near thing. You OK?
Yes, I'm OK.

660
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:24,362
I thought you were
shaky there for a second.

661
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:30,569
Beverly, it's past nine.

662
00:51:34,573 --> 00:51:37,132
You're late. You've gotta get up.

663
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:40,128
I need something to get me up.

664
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:42,169
You know where it is.

665
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:46,891
Claire, will you call Danuta...

666
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:50,328
tell her to cancel
my first three patients.

667
00:51:52,133 --> 00:51:54,088
I'll never make it.

668
00:52:05,453 --> 00:52:07,012
Can't eat.

669
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:09,733
What's wrong?
I don't know, I can't eat!

670
00:52:09,814 --> 00:52:11,964
If you don't know, I do.

671
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:15,888
Too many sleepers last night,
that's what.

672
00:52:15,973 --> 00:52:17,930
Look who's talking.

673
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:20,050
Maybe you ought to take a week off.

674
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:23,170
Just stop everything.

675
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,931
I'm serious.

676
00:52:26,014 --> 00:52:28,164
I'll talk to Elly when he gets back.

677
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:31,644
I couldn't do anything before then.
Elliot is back.

678
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:38,213
He... called here for you
while you were in the shower.

679
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,172
You spoke to him?

680
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:43,370
Well, I couldn't help it, could I?

681
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:48,687
I explained to him that you were
staying here with me for a few days.

682
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,367
How did he react?

683
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:54,292
Civilized.

684
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:58,050
He apologized...
for the scene in the bar...

685
00:52:58,135 --> 00:53:01,572
and I more or less...
accepted his apology.

686
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:04,571
Where are you going?

687
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:06,373
Leo's in town.

688
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:08,412
I told you about Leo...

689
00:53:08,495 --> 00:53:10,451
and my Georgia picture.

690
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,208
We're close to a deal.

691
00:53:12,295 --> 00:53:14,253
Don't go. I want you to stay.

692
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:18,813
Beverly...

693
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,453
I can't.

694
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:22,207
OK. Yeah.

695
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:31,247
Um, could you tell me
which is the make-up trailer?

696
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:33,896
This one here?
Who are you looking for?

697
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:36,126
Miss Niveau.
She expecting you?

698
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:37,968
Yes, she is.

699
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,815
Fascinating stuff.

700
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:52,814
Lucky old Bev.
He gets to rub up against the magic.

701
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,488
He seems totally uninterested.

702
00:53:57,457 --> 00:53:59,209
Bev's not into art.

703
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,096
You are?

704
00:54:02,177 --> 00:54:04,134
I'm into glamor...

705
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:07,333
the art of glamor.

706
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:10,770
Well, here it is.

707
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:24,208
I was surprised you wanted to see me.

708
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:28,214
Give us a few minutes, please.

709
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:41,655
I like your brother very much...

710
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:44,299
and I thought it would be good...

711
00:54:44,379 --> 00:54:46,938
for you and me... to be friends...

712
00:54:48,379 --> 00:54:49,937
if we can.

713
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:51,974
I think we can.

714
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:56,096
There's something else.

715
00:54:56,179 --> 00:55:01,047
I'm going away to do another film.
I'm worried about leaving Bev alone.

716
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:03,095
Bev's not alone.

717
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,932
No, you're right, he's not alone...

718
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,850
but he's lonely...

719
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,895
even with me.

720
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:15,292
He's developing a serious drug problem.
Did you realize that?

721
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:17,941
I thought you had the drug problem.

722
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,975
It's an occupational hazard.

723
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,177
The same goes for Beverly.

724
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,853
You resent me tremendously, don't you?

725
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:28,896
You contribute...

726
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:33,211
a confusing element
to the Mantle brothers' saga.

727
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:36,296
Possibly a destructive one.

728
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,252
It's not personal.

729
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,297
I think you're terrific.

730
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:50,930
But I just don't have a role
in the Mantle brothers' saga.

731
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:54,139
I suppose...

732
00:55:56,262 --> 00:55:58,217
if you liked us both...

733
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:01,813
in the same way...

734
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,417
it might make things easier.

735
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,938
It has been known to happen.

736
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:13,579
I'm sorry...

737
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,618
but I can't.

738
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:26,421
Am I really that different from Beverly?

739
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,494
You really are.

740
00:56:42,383 --> 00:56:44,533
Claire, let me come to the airport.

741
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:47,376
Beverly, please, no public goodbyes.

742
00:56:51,463 --> 00:56:53,418
Ten weeks is such a long time.

743
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:56,502
I'll fly up...

744
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,540
whenever there's a break.

745
00:57:02,264 --> 00:57:03,821
Claire...

746
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:08,339
let's not lose each other.

747
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:17,460
Birchall, will you please explain...

748
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:20,504
to my director
and my wardrobe person...

749
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:24,135
I am not about to do this movie
dressed like a 10-dollar hooker.

750
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:27,617
Miss Niveau is not about
to do this movie...

751
00:58:27,706 --> 00:58:30,425
dressed like a 10-dollar hooker.

752
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:31,825
Well...

753
00:58:31,906 --> 00:58:34,216
Claire, you will admit, at least...

754
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:38,458
your character thinks of herself
as a kind of emotional hooker.

755
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:40,502
Oh, I do more than admit it.

756
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:46,462
I'm the one who pointed it out
to this... wardrobe person.

757
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:51,143
But she's so bloody literal-minded.

758
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:56,263
Wardrobe person?
She called me "wardrobe person"!

759
00:58:56,347 --> 00:58:58,145
I know, I know.

760
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:02,022
Hello. Niveau suite.

761
00:59:06,146 --> 00:59:07,943
Hello?

762
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:09,983
Hello?

763
00:59:12,267 --> 00:59:15,498
Have you examined her... c-carefully yet?

764
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:18,260
What? Who is this?

765
00:59:22,748 --> 00:59:24,703
I'm her gynecologist.

766
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,420
You're... what?

767
00:59:27,508 --> 00:59:29,816
I'm Claire Niveau's gynecologist!

768
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:33,583
Did you know that she was a trifurcate?

769
00:59:36,308 --> 00:59:39,061
I'd have to classify that as a mutation.

770
00:59:39,148 --> 00:59:41,104
What exactly is this?

771
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:44,104
Is that you, Byron?

772
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:51,337
Carefully lubricate the two
prime fingers of your right hand...

773
00:59:52,508 --> 00:59:54,261
and insert them...

774
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:56,909
into Claire Niveau's vagina.

775
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,387
Instead of feeling one cervical head...

776
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:06,024
you will feel three.

777
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:10,746
Basically, this means...

778
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:14,982
that you have been fucking a mutant!

779
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:26,063
Oh, Doctor, I'm sorry...

780
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,027
I thought you were ready
to see Mrs. Randall.

781
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:35,386
Mrs. Randall, please come and sit down.
I don't think we've met.

782
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:40,949
Let me introduce myself.
I'm one of the Mantle twins.

783
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,784
The lesion, not surprisingly...

784
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,862
causes diffuse enlargement
of the cervix...

785
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:52,267
and, of course, our old friend,
leucorrhoea.

786
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:55,024
Until very recently...

787
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:59,423
diagnosis tended to be done
after a histological examination...

788
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:04,107
of the removed organ. A case of
throwing the baby out with the bath water.

789
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:09,782
I'm sorry, Doctor, but your brother
is waiting for you in your office.

790
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:11,828
I think you'd better go see him.

791
01:01:15,512 --> 01:01:17,467
Bev, what are you doing here?

792
01:01:22,672 --> 01:01:24,231
What's wrong?

793
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:39,102
I've been hiding out at Claire's.

794
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:44,101
I've been hiding from you.

795
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:45,706
Hiding?

796
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:47,748
What are you talking about?

797
01:01:47,832 --> 01:01:49,585
I was afraid of...

798
01:01:54,913 --> 01:01:58,063
I was af... afraid you wouldn't
let me have her.

799
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,385
Oh, that's crazy, Bev.

800
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:07,629
It is crazy because...

801
01:02:11,153 --> 01:02:12,711
yesterday...

802
01:02:19,714 --> 01:02:21,670
yesterday...

803
01:02:23,954 --> 01:02:26,707
I found out that she was having
an affair.

804
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,669
She's unfaithful to me, Elly.

805
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:36,314
Bev, you mustn't take it so seriously.

806
01:02:37,994 --> 01:02:39,950
She's a showbiz lady.

807
01:02:40,034 --> 01:02:41,990
What can you expect?

808
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:44,869
I'm in love with her!

809
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:50,668
I have to take it seriously.

810
01:02:59,635 --> 01:03:02,433
It can't be love
if it does this to you, can it?

811
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:07,707
It can't be love, Bev.

812
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,627
You're right, Elly.

813
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:18,185
I was hiding from the wrong person.

814
01:04:15,877 --> 01:04:17,231
Dance?

815
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,910
No.

816
01:04:23,837 --> 01:04:25,395
You go ahead.

817
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:31,149
Go on, Bev, dance with the girl.

818
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,440
What's the matter, Bev?
I just can't.

819
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,079
Bev, stay with us.

820
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:04,480
Stay with me.

821
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,313
Bev!

822
01:06:26,281 --> 01:06:27,839
He collapsed.

823
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:43,718
Fuck, he's not breathing!

824
01:06:47,482 --> 01:06:50,236
Don't touch him, he's my brother!

825
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,361
Come on, Bev!

826
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:03,361
Come on!

827
01:07:18,524 --> 01:07:20,478
Bev?

828
01:07:20,563 --> 01:07:22,121
Bev!

829
01:07:25,163 --> 01:07:26,517
Elly...

830
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,199
thank God you're here.

831
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:31,036
Oh, God!

832
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:35,316
Oh, Bev...

833
01:07:36,364 --> 01:07:38,719
look at you, you're a mess...

834
01:07:38,803 --> 01:07:40,557
you're a wreck.

835
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:43,360
You could've had a stroke, Bev.

836
01:07:46,205 --> 01:07:48,435
You're lucky to be in one piece.

837
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:50,879
One piece.

838
01:07:54,725 --> 01:07:56,476
Bev...

839
01:07:56,565 --> 01:07:59,921
we can't let anyone know
about the drugs.

840
01:08:01,165 --> 01:08:03,519
If that gets out, we're finished.

841
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:07,000
How... would they know?

842
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:11,953
I had to fight them off to stop them
taking a blood sample...

843
01:08:12,045 --> 01:08:14,354
but I can't stay here day and night.

844
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:18,074
I've got to get you off the pills
without anybody knowing.

845
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:26,759
Do you think I'm really addicted?

846
01:08:34,886 --> 01:08:39,003
I'll put you on a detox program.
I'll supervise it myself.

847
01:08:58,687 --> 01:09:00,246
There you go.

848
01:09:09,206 --> 01:09:13,645
Darling, tell me what's going on.
Mother, I'm at the end of my rope!

849
01:09:13,728 --> 01:09:16,764
I cannot live in that house
another second!

850
01:09:16,846 --> 01:09:19,999
Every relationship
has its ups and downs, dear.

851
01:09:20,087 --> 01:09:21,645
You and Tommy...

852
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:26,158
Bev, there's a couple of things
we're gonna have to...

853
01:09:26,967 --> 01:09:29,323
Why are you taking that apart?

854
01:09:29,408 --> 01:09:31,967
Elly... I can't sleep.

855
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:36,200
If you're asking me for a sleeper,
you're not gonna get one.

856
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:38,040
What am I gonna do, then?

857
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:39,881
You'll stay up.

858
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:48,249
Elly, I'll die if I don't sleep!

859
01:09:48,328 --> 01:09:49,647
You'll stay up.

860
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:52,083
What if I take something
when you go home?

861
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:53,317
I'm staying here.

862
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:56,161
What if I take something
when you go to sleep?

863
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:58,045
I won't.
How will you stay awake?

864
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:00,244
I'll take something!

865
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:03,685
You'll take an up
so that I don't take a down?

866
01:10:03,768 --> 01:10:05,999
This is crazy!
Bev...

867
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:08,239
Don't worry about me. I'm not you.

868
01:10:10,129 --> 01:10:12,484
And don't destroy that.

869
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,760
Ow, that really hurts.

870
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:22,402
This?

871
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,562
This... hurts?

872
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,847
I don't know exactly
what it is that's hurting...

873
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:41,122
Mrs. Bookman,
this is a solid gold Mantle retractor.

874
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,962
Solid gold!

875
01:10:43,051 --> 01:10:45,007
It's the best there is.

876
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,525
This clinic's the best there is!

877
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,168
I mean...

878
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:51,207
we have the technology.

879
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:00,722
It couldn't possibly hurt.
I-I didn't mean to...

880
01:11:00,811 --> 01:11:02,767
When did you last have a period?

881
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:05,524
I haven't had one in four or five months.

882
01:11:05,611 --> 01:11:09,763
And does it... hurt...
when you have intercourse?

883
01:11:11,211 --> 01:11:12,769
Yes, it does.

884
01:11:32,693 --> 01:11:34,250
Where was I?

885
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:37,608
You... asked me whether or not it hurt...

886
01:11:37,691 --> 01:11:39,921
when I had intercourse...
Yes.

887
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:49,252
What exactly did you have
intercourse with?

888
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:52,444
What do you mean?

889
01:11:53,812 --> 01:11:55,370
I just wondered.

890
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,965
I was once asked...

891
01:12:01,053 --> 01:12:02,610
to treat a woman...

892
01:12:02,692 --> 01:12:05,844
who had had... intercourse...

893
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:09,689
with a Labrador retriever.

894
01:12:12,613 --> 01:12:14,366
I thought...

895
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:17,527
maybe...

896
01:12:19,894 --> 01:12:21,849
You used this on Mrs. Bookman?

897
01:12:21,934 --> 01:12:23,491
Yes.

898
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:27,691
Bev... this is not for internals,
remember?

899
01:12:27,773 --> 01:12:31,322
This is for surgical retraction.
No wonder it hurt her!

900
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,769
No, no, it's not the...

901
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:37,847
There's nothing the matter
with the instrument! It's the body!

902
01:12:39,334 --> 01:12:41,290
The woman's body was all wrong!

903
01:13:09,974 --> 01:13:13,854
Yes, I think you'll find
his work quite interesting.

904
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:17,733
Why don't you drop by
later on this evening?

905
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:21,048
Just a moment, please.

906
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:22,488
May I help you?

907
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:25,726
I wonder if you could
put me in touch with Mr. Wolleck.

908
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:30,367
Perfect timing. Mr. Wolleck is right
over there working on a new piece.

909
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:35,211
That's Mr. Wolleck? He works here?
Mm-hm. It's part of his show.

910
01:13:37,015 --> 01:13:38,972
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

911
01:13:39,056 --> 01:13:42,014
I was wondering
if you could help me with these.

912
01:13:46,616 --> 01:13:48,571
Fascinating.

913
01:13:48,656 --> 01:13:50,612
They're quite beautiful.

914
01:13:51,455 --> 01:13:53,014
What are they?

915
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:55,611
They're gynecological instruments...

916
01:13:55,696 --> 01:13:57,846
for working on mutant women.

917
01:13:57,937 --> 01:13:59,893
Mutant women?

918
01:14:05,096 --> 01:14:07,611
That's a great theme for a show.

919
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:10,130
No, it's not for a show. It's not art.

920
01:14:11,177 --> 01:14:13,407
I'm a doctor, I need them for my work.

921
01:14:13,497 --> 01:14:15,452
That's a little out of my line.

922
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:17,570
What do you want me to do?

923
01:14:17,657 --> 01:14:21,207
Well, I need
three-dimensional prototypes...

924
01:14:21,297 --> 01:14:23,253
in surgical steel...

925
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:25,293
cast...

926
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,334
hand-finished...

927
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:29,373
functioning.

928
01:14:29,457 --> 01:14:31,414
And I thought maybe...

929
01:14:31,498 --> 01:14:34,375
Aren't there large companies
in this town...

930
01:14:34,457 --> 01:14:36,813
No! No, no, no, I can't go to them!

931
01:14:36,897 --> 01:14:38,854
It's too radical for them!

932
01:14:38,938 --> 01:14:40,894
We've always been too radical.

933
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:43,855
I mean... I can't!

934
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,088
It's too... It's too complicated.

935
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:51,657
I think maybe we could...
work something out.

936
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:56,292
I've had it with the bullshit
from this office!

937
01:14:56,379 --> 01:15:00,735
I've asked you ten times to transfer
my wife's records to the Mount Sinai.

938
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:04,333
You haven't done it.
They refuse to admit her without them.

939
01:15:04,419 --> 01:15:06,409
What is going on?
I'm so sorry.

940
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:09,093
The doctors assured me they'd been sent.

941
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:12,933
Bullshit! I want those files
in my hand before I leave!

942
01:15:13,019 --> 01:15:16,056
Mr. Glaser, I assure you
I'll do everything I can.

943
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,531
Not now.

944
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:22,133
Doctor, I have to speak to you.

945
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:24,174
Not now!

946
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:36,215
Doctor, I'm... giving you my notice.
I won't work under these conditions.

947
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,978
Fine.

948
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,054
Fine.

949
01:16:33,782 --> 01:16:35,932
We're all set, Beverly.

950
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:48,700
We'll use these.

951
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:54,535
Give us the tools
and we will do the job.

952
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:59,182
I-I'm afraid I'm not familiar...

953
01:16:59,262 --> 01:17:01,493
with these instruments, Doctor.

954
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:04,538
I've just had them made.

955
01:17:04,623 --> 01:17:06,579
They're brand-new.

956
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:10,136
Well... number them...

957
01:17:10,223 --> 01:17:14,535
one to ten, from left to right.

958
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,183
Give me the one... that I ask for.

959
01:17:19,103 --> 01:17:20,660
Give me number five.

960
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:27,096
Now, please!
Yes... number five.

961
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,542
Number five.

962
01:17:36,664 --> 01:17:38,222
No...!

963
01:17:39,424 --> 01:17:41,415
Jesus Christ, Beverly!

964
01:17:43,303 --> 01:17:46,661
I've got...
I've got to slow everything down.

965
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:51,619
I need something
to slow everything down...

966
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:57,902
Let go!

967
01:17:59,784 --> 01:18:04,062
Oh, my God, she's bleeding!
Get a clamp, for God's sake!

968
01:18:04,144 --> 01:18:07,103
Get him the hell outta here!

969
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:14,181
I am more than willing
to apologize for my behavior.

970
01:18:16,704 --> 01:18:18,855
I have been working too hard. I...

971
01:18:20,105 --> 01:18:24,065
I must be more realistic about...
my energy levels, and...

972
01:18:24,904 --> 01:18:27,294
about my ability to concentrate...

973
01:18:27,386 --> 01:18:30,344
for long periods of time under pressure.

974
01:18:33,466 --> 01:18:35,216
I must add, however...

975
01:18:35,306 --> 01:18:38,854
these accusations arise
out of a lack of understanding...

976
01:18:38,945 --> 01:18:42,301
of the radical techniques
my brother and I are known for.

977
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:47,016
And I think there's a certain amount
of professional jealousy involved...

978
01:18:49,906 --> 01:18:51,464
as well.

979
01:18:55,386 --> 01:18:57,139
That's fine, sir.

980
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:04,178
We always intended to ease ourselves
into pure research, anyway.

981
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:06,579
No.

982
01:19:10,306 --> 01:19:14,266
I don't think that'll be necessary.
You have our cooperation.

983
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,623
They didn't buy it, Bev.

984
01:19:24,707 --> 01:19:26,663
I think they knew it was me.

985
01:19:28,187 --> 01:19:30,748
They said we could've killed her.

986
01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:35,457
They said the woman could've died.

987
01:19:35,547 --> 01:19:37,266
They're lying!

988
01:19:37,348 --> 01:19:39,303
They've always been jealous.

989
01:19:39,387 --> 01:19:42,141
They won't revoke
our hospital privileges...

990
01:19:42,228 --> 01:19:44,616
as long as we don't ever use them again.

991
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,266
Fuck 'em!

992
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:49,624
We always planned to ease ourselves
into pure research.

993
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:52,461
I certainly always planned it. Didn't you?

994
01:20:07,509 --> 01:20:09,977
There seems to be some problem about...

995
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:12,586
surgical instruments.

996
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:17,780
About holding them as evidence
of a disturbed mind.

997
01:20:27,109 --> 01:20:29,577
Do you know what they're talking about?

998
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:32,024
I tried to tell you, Elly!

999
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:36,068
You don't know the kind of patients
we've been getting lately.

1000
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,983
You don't know what's going on out there.

1001
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,344
The patients are getting strange.

1002
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:46,258
They look all right on the outside...

1003
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,102
but their insides...

1004
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:51,748
they're deformed.

1005
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:54,264
Well, I had to deal with it somehow!

1006
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:59,340
Radical technology was required!

1007
01:21:03,311 --> 01:21:05,063
You're right, Bev.

1008
01:21:06,031 --> 01:21:08,828
Something radical is definitely required.

1009
01:21:43,552 --> 01:21:46,782
Right, I want you to take...
three of these now.

1010
01:21:50,112 --> 01:21:52,910
Take three around seven
this evening...

1011
01:21:54,112 --> 01:21:56,182
three before you go to sleep...

1012
01:21:56,272 --> 01:21:59,026
and three when you wake up
in the morning.

1013
01:21:59,112 --> 01:22:01,262
Yes, Doctor!

1014
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:05,585
Can I trust you to do that, or have
I got to sit here and watch you?

1015
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:07,230
I don't know.

1016
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:11,104
Can you trust me?

1017
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,545
Oh, God!

1018
01:22:14,473 --> 01:22:16,429
Don't do this to me, Bev.

1019
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:19,793
But I'm only doing it to me, Elly.

1020
01:22:24,393 --> 01:22:26,749
Don't you have a will of your own?

1021
01:22:29,952 --> 01:22:35,711
Why don't you just go on
with your very own life?

1022
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:40,752
Do you remember
the original Siamese twins?

1023
01:22:42,793 --> 01:22:44,546
Chang and Eng.

1024
01:22:45,435 --> 01:22:47,789
They were joined at the chest.

1025
01:22:51,314 --> 01:22:53,270
Remember how they died?

1026
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:55,663
Mm.

1027
01:22:56,714 --> 01:22:58,148
Chang...

1028
01:22:58,235 --> 01:23:00,589
died of a stroke...

1029
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,825
in the middle of the night.

1030
01:23:02,914 --> 01:23:05,348
He was always the sickly one.

1031
01:23:06,235 --> 01:23:11,183
He was always the one
who drank too much.

1032
01:23:11,274 --> 01:23:14,824
When Eng woke up beside him...

1033
01:23:14,915 --> 01:23:18,066
and found that his brother was dead...

1034
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:23,391
he died of fright...

1035
01:23:26,316 --> 01:23:29,036
right there in the bed.

1036
01:23:32,315 --> 01:23:35,353
Does that answer your question?

1037
01:23:38,635 --> 01:23:40,591
Poor Elly.

1038
01:23:41,996 --> 01:23:44,715
Poor Bev.

1039
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:40,077
Everything's under control.
I don't see what the problem is.

1040
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,549
Now the hospital's getting complaints
about your private practice.

1041
01:24:44,637 --> 01:24:48,915
They've even approached me.
Informally, of course.

1042
01:24:48,997 --> 01:24:50,953
Off the record, of course.

1043
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:56,151
They asked me all about Bev:
Is he a junkie? Everything.

1044
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:59,517
Of course, you didn't tell them anything.

1045
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,914
Of course not.

1046
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:08,754
But you can't go on insulating yourselves.
They're gonna nail you.

1047
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:13,992
They're gonna be forced to nail you.
The clinic's none of their business.

1048
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:20,350
Wow, it's getting hard
to tell the two of you apart.

1049
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,035
What did you do that for?

1050
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:30,553
It's my favorite fucking program!

1051
01:25:30,638 --> 01:25:32,595
Elly, Elly, Elly...

1052
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:35,432
you haven't done anything wrong.

1053
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,037
Look, your reputation's
separate from Bev's.

1054
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:41,075
You've still got a career.

1055
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:42,718
Cary...

1056
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:49,191
my brother's research
is the basis of my career.

1057
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,798
I need him.

1058
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,073
Besides...

1059
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,634
the truth is, nobody can tell us apart.

1060
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,834
We are perceived as one person.

1061
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,319
If Bev goes down the tubes, I go with him.

1062
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,633
I've got to get him back.

1063
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:15,315
I think that's too dangerous for you.

1064
01:26:15,841 --> 01:26:19,834
I think you're the last person on earth
who should try to do that.

1065
01:26:19,921 --> 01:26:22,151
You've got to stay away from him now.

1066
01:26:22,921 --> 01:26:25,229
Sure, go find him some help...

1067
01:26:25,321 --> 01:26:29,872
but, for God's sakes, Elliot,
you've got to cut yourself loose.

1068
01:26:29,962 --> 01:26:31,918
It wouldn't work.
Why?

1069
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:34,357
Look, don't you get it yet?

1070
01:26:35,081 --> 01:26:39,040
Whatever's in his bloodstream
goes directly into mine.

1071
01:26:41,642 --> 01:26:43,393
You can't be serious.

1072
01:26:44,202 --> 01:26:47,080
That is an objective medical observation.

1073
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:48,720
No, no!

1074
01:26:48,802 --> 01:26:52,511
No, it's not true.
You're making it true, but it's not true.

1075
01:26:52,602 --> 01:26:57,153
You don't put these in your mouth,
they don't end up in your bloodstream!

1076
01:27:03,963 --> 01:27:06,760
Beverly and I just have
to get synchronized.

1077
01:27:10,243 --> 01:27:12,802
Once we're synchronized, it'll be easy.

1078
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:34,916
Hello?
Who's this?

1079
01:27:38,723 --> 01:27:40,476
It's Beverly.

1080
01:27:40,564 --> 01:27:42,713
Beverly, it's Claire.

1081
01:27:43,483 --> 01:27:45,042
I'm back.

1082
01:27:46,004 --> 01:27:47,436
Claire?

1083
01:27:47,524 --> 01:27:50,482
Beverly, why haven't I
been able to reach you?

1084
01:27:50,563 --> 01:27:52,394
Why haven't you called me?

1085
01:27:54,324 --> 01:27:56,280
Claire...

1086
01:27:58,004 --> 01:27:59,959
why did you betray me?

1087
01:28:00,044 --> 01:28:01,999
What are you talking about?

1088
01:28:04,604 --> 01:28:05,958
That...

1089
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:08,956
That man...

1090
01:28:10,164 --> 01:28:12,121
That man in your hotel room.

1091
01:28:13,324 --> 01:28:15,076
Ohh!

1092
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:16,917
My God!

1093
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:18,960
Was that you who called?

1094
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:22,197
That was my secretary - Birchall.

1095
01:28:22,925 --> 01:28:24,677
He's defiantly gay...

1096
01:28:24,764 --> 01:28:27,723
and you managed
to gross him out completely.

1097
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:31,836
Beverly...

1098
01:28:31,925 --> 01:28:33,678
I want you to come and see me.

1099
01:28:35,206 --> 01:28:37,161
Come to me right now.

1100
01:29:09,767 --> 01:29:11,325
Yeah?

1101
01:29:11,406 --> 01:29:13,363
Mr. Virdo?
Uh-huh.

1102
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:16,008
This is Dr. Mantle.
Oh, yeah.

1103
01:29:16,647 --> 01:29:19,445
I know this sounds awfully silly...

1104
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:23,487
but I'm afraid I've...
There's been a terrible mix-up.

1105
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,560
I've locked myself... into the clinic.

1106
01:29:27,406 --> 01:29:32,528
Um... I was wondering if you'd mind
coming up and... and letting me out.

1107
01:29:33,727 --> 01:29:35,479
I'll be right there.

1108
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:41,959
Dr. Mantle...

1109
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:43,605
Lee Virdo.

1110
01:29:49,368 --> 01:29:51,359
Er...
Just a minute, Mr. Virdo.

1111
01:29:51,448 --> 01:29:54,406
OK. I think there's...
something stuck there.

1112
01:29:58,689 --> 01:30:00,643
What's going on in there?

1113
01:30:02,488 --> 01:30:04,046
You know...

1114
01:30:04,128 --> 01:30:05,881
Endless renovations.

1115
01:30:06,169 --> 01:30:07,727
Oh, yeah.

1116
01:30:11,929 --> 01:30:14,284
Um... You'd better lock it.

1117
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:16,324
Yeah, sure.

1118
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:25,929
Are you coming down?
Yeah.

1119
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:32,282
Are you all right?

1120
01:30:33,329 --> 01:30:34,683
Yes...

1121
01:30:34,769 --> 01:30:36,521
I'm fine.

1122
01:30:36,609 --> 01:30:39,170
You don't look so hot.
I'm fine!

1123
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:42,767
Thank you.

1124
01:30:42,849 --> 01:30:44,602
You're the doctor.

1125
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:33,200
Excuse me, what are you doing?

1126
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:35,521
They're mine!
They've been sold!

1127
01:31:35,612 --> 01:31:38,170
I'm taking them.
He's made another copy!

1128
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,606
They're mine and I'm taking them!

1129
01:31:41,651 --> 01:31:43,404
They're not yours!

1130
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:46,723
They're not yours!

1131
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:54,005
Claire!

1132
01:31:55,091 --> 01:31:56,445
Claire!

1133
01:31:58,771 --> 01:32:01,332
Beverly, my love,
what's wrong with you?

1134
01:32:01,413 --> 01:32:03,368
I've got to have some Seconal.

1135
01:32:03,452 --> 01:32:05,727
I'm sorry...
I've got to have some!

1136
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:07,962
I don't have anything at all.
Oh!

1137
01:32:08,052 --> 01:32:09,805
Oh, fuck!

1138
01:32:12,294 --> 01:32:14,443
It's all right.
No!

1139
01:32:20,172 --> 01:32:22,323
I'll write a prescription for you.

1140
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,330
They'll fill it for you.

1141
01:32:29,453 --> 01:32:32,206
I've got to have them, Claire!
Oui.

1142
01:32:32,853 --> 01:32:35,287
Don't tell Elliot... that I'm here.

1143
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:37,891
Why?

1144
01:32:39,334 --> 01:32:41,289
I think he's becoming...

1145
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:44,086
a drug addict.

1146
01:32:45,334 --> 01:32:48,406
I think he's becoming... dangerous.

1147
01:33:25,695 --> 01:33:27,651
Are you sure he didn't call?

1148
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:29,487
I'm sure.

1149
01:33:32,935 --> 01:33:34,687
It's not like Elliot.

1150
01:33:37,456 --> 01:33:39,014
It's been...

1151
01:33:39,095 --> 01:33:41,052
It's been almost a week.

1152
01:33:42,894 --> 01:33:47,731
You know Elliot. I would've expected
him to be kicking the door in by now.

1153
01:33:47,816 --> 01:33:50,330
Well, I haven't heard a word from him.

1154
01:33:59,295 --> 01:34:01,252
Didn't call when I was asleep?

1155
01:34:01,336 --> 01:34:02,689
No.

1156
01:34:13,576 --> 01:34:15,329
Tell me about...

1157
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,769
these...

1158
01:34:18,656 --> 01:34:20,214
these tools.

1159
01:34:22,896 --> 01:34:24,329
Tools?

1160
01:34:28,737 --> 01:34:30,887
Surgical... instruments.

1161
01:34:32,497 --> 01:34:35,057
You had them with you when you came.

1162
01:34:35,537 --> 01:34:37,095
Did I?

1163
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:39,406
Yes.

1164
01:34:45,777 --> 01:34:47,336
What are they for?

1165
01:34:47,418 --> 01:34:50,171
They're for separating Siamese twins.

1166
01:34:54,698 --> 01:34:56,256
I must go back.

1167
01:34:58,018 --> 01:35:00,816
Don't go back. Stay here.

1168
01:35:00,898 --> 01:35:03,048
I must go now. I'll take these.

1169
01:35:08,538 --> 01:35:10,096
I'll come back.

1170
01:35:11,977 --> 01:35:14,334
Your brother won't let you come back.

1171
01:35:16,459 --> 01:35:18,414
How could he stop me?

1172
01:36:51,182 --> 01:36:54,332
Hey... welcome home, kid.

1173
01:36:57,222 --> 01:37:00,100
We've got to take a shot
of Dilantin tonight...

1174
01:37:00,942 --> 01:37:02,933
otherwise we might convulse.

1175
01:37:03,022 --> 01:37:04,580
Right.

1176
01:37:06,382 --> 01:37:07,941
Don't forget.

1177
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:10,460
Right.

1178
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:13,580
Then we go to Percodan in the morning.

1179
01:37:14,823 --> 01:37:16,381
Mm, right.

1180
01:37:20,103 --> 01:37:23,982
Then, in the afternoon,
we have a little treat.

1181
01:37:24,942 --> 01:37:27,503
Dilaudid. Just because it's Saturday.

1182
01:37:29,384 --> 01:37:31,817
So on Monday, we kick, right?

1183
01:37:32,823 --> 01:37:34,382
We agreed.

1184
01:37:34,463 --> 01:37:37,820
We have to start
to pull things back together then.

1185
01:37:37,903 --> 01:37:39,461
Oh, yes...

1186
01:37:39,542 --> 01:37:42,216
on Monday we definitely kick.

1187
01:37:43,703 --> 01:37:45,455
How about some cake?

1188
01:37:46,503 --> 01:37:48,256
I could go for that.

1189
01:38:04,103 --> 01:38:05,857
And some orange pop.

1190
01:38:09,344 --> 01:38:11,096
Some ice cream.

1191
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:13,414
We haven't got any ice cream, Elly.

1192
01:38:15,344 --> 01:38:18,303
Mummy forgot to buy it.

1193
01:38:23,265 --> 01:38:24,823
I want...

1194
01:38:24,905 --> 01:38:27,259
some ice cream!

1195
01:38:39,345 --> 01:38:41,098
Happy birthday, Elly.

1196
01:38:47,705 --> 01:38:49,661
It's not our birthday, Bev.

1197
01:38:51,626 --> 01:38:53,980
Yes, it is.

1198
01:38:59,985 --> 01:39:02,341
Happy birthday, baby brother.

1199
01:39:24,587 --> 01:39:28,546
We are about to separate
the Siamese twins.

1200
01:39:40,988 --> 01:39:43,502
Don't forget the good part!

1201
01:39:46,987 --> 01:39:48,545
Oh, yes!

1202
01:39:54,267 --> 01:39:59,023
Chang was always most concerned
about dulling the pain.

1203
01:40:16,628 --> 01:40:18,380
Don't waste it.

1204
01:40:30,789 --> 01:40:32,746
Tell me when it takes effect.

1205
01:40:32,829 --> 01:40:35,502
I don't think I'll notice anything.

1206
01:40:37,149 --> 01:40:39,106
You can start when you like.

1207
01:41:24,951 --> 01:41:26,702
Do you think...

1208
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:29,782
the morticulator is required, Eng?

1209
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:33,310
I think...

1210
01:41:34,711 --> 01:41:37,101
everything is required, Chang.

1211
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:46,463
Why are you crying?

1212
01:41:51,032 --> 01:41:52,987
Separation can be...

1213
01:41:56,432 --> 01:41:58,388
a terrifying thing.

1214
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,428
Don't worry, baby brother...

1215
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:07,507
we'll always...

1216
01:42:09,432 --> 01:42:11,992
We'll always be together.

1217
01:43:08,994 --> 01:43:10,346
Elly?

1218
01:43:11,954 --> 01:43:13,910
I had a terrible dream.

1219
01:43:16,674 --> 01:43:18,427
Elly?

1220
01:43:26,874 --> 01:43:28,228
Elly...

1221
01:43:39,955 --> 01:43:41,308
Elly?

1222
01:43:42,355 --> 01:43:43,708
Elly!

1223
01:43:46,276 --> 01:43:50,235
Elly... Elly... Elly...

1224
01:43:52,356 --> 01:43:54,505
Elly... Elly...

1225
01:43:55,636 --> 01:43:57,991
Elly... Elly...

1226
01:43:59,036 --> 01:44:01,948
Elly... Elly...

1227
01:44:03,316 --> 01:44:07,673
Elly... Elly... Elly...

1228
01:44:09,357 --> 01:44:10,790
Elly...

1229
01:44:12,036 --> 01:44:13,788
Elly...

1230
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,629
Elly...

1231
01:44:17,836 --> 01:44:19,395
Elly...

1232
01:44:20,716 --> 01:44:22,673
Elly...

1233
01:44:23,756 --> 01:44:25,315
Elly...

1234
01:44:26,356 --> 01:44:27,790
Elly...

1235
01:44:28,837 --> 01:44:30,394
Elly...

1236
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,272
Hello?

1237
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:13,918
Hello?

1238
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,752
Who is this?
